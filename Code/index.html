    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>India has always been a major part of history. It ranges from the first civilizations to the most beautiful architecture. 4
    major religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism have all been birthed here. India&#39;s economy was the world&#39;s
    largest until 1700 CE, and still continues to be a country at the forefront of the world stage. From 880 languages in 29
    states, India has over time become extremely diverse. Now we will look at the history that made it so.</p>

    <p>This is the beginning of Bronze Age civilization in the Indian sub-continent, <b>as one of the three Cradles of
    Civilization,</b> the others being Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. It is named as such due to the fact that it was mainly
    centered on the Indus river&#39;s delta and its surrounding areas, It came to an end in 1700 BCE, although some elements
    survived. The civilization was larger than both Mesopotamia and Egypt combined, and had superior structure. The earliest Indus
    Valley Civilzation claims extend all the way to the 6th millenium BCE.</p><img src="images/Mohenjodaro.png" alt="Mohenjo Daro, the largest city in the civilization">
