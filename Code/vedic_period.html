      <h1>Basic information</h1>


      <p>The Vedic Period is most widely recognized as the age in which the earliest and holiest of the Hindu scriptures were composed, the Vedas, consisting
      of the Rig, Atharva, Yajur and Sama Vedas. The Vedas were purportedly written by a group of people known as the &quot;Aryans,&quot; as they migrated from
      Central Asia and the European steppes, mixing their gentic haplogroups with those originally found in India. This period is characterized by the
      establishment of the first long term kingdoms in India, during the Iron Age. The first republic, known as Vaishali was also formed. These kingdoms and
      republics formed the janapadas.</p>

      <h2>Characteristics present in all time periods</h2>


      <p>The socio-economic structure of Vedic times was not as rigid as found in India today, where birth can determine the potential of a person&#39;s life.
      Political structure was still largely defined by rigid guidelines, with a &quot;raja&quot; or chief presiding over a &quot;jana.&quot; As the
      kingship/chiefship became a more important role, the roles of others in society became solidified. The core of the Hindu religion was formed during this
      time.</p>


      <h2>Early Vedic</h2>


      <p>The Early Vedic period contains few events of great political importance. The most major may be the &quot;Battle of 10 Kings,&quot; wherein the king
      of the Bharatas defeated 10 other kings in combat. Due to the earlier decay of the Indus Valley Civilization, there had to be another transition from
      nomadic movement to village based settlements.</p>

      <h2>Late Vedic</h2>


      <p>In the Late Vedic period, religious texts had undergone their final revisions, and the settlements became completely permanent. The first known
      &quot;state&quot; was the Kuru Kingdom, a conglomeration of tribes presiding over a large dominion. This would lay the basis for later kingdoms covering
      large swathes of land, and was the progenitor of several kingdoms.</p>

      <h2>Moving towards an urbanization</h2>


      <p>In spite of the fact that the Kuru Kingdom did have a common area of land, cities or large urban centres did not form. This would be largely due to
      the equal autonomy of each chief, in part dividing wealth that could have been used to further urbanization of the state. Trade networks were
      strengthened, and this pressure on the former economic model led it to give way, leading to an urbanization. Close to the end of this era and throughout the next, new teachings
      of the Buddha and Mahavira of Buddhism and Jainism respectivley were spread through the land. The final foundation for the Sanskrit language was laid out
      with the Grammar of Panini.</p>
