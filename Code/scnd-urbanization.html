      post the demise of the Indus Valley Civilization, this was the period that shaped India for the years to come.</p>

      <h2>Uniform urbanization</h2>


      <p>The second urbanization is so-called as it is the first set of large scale civilizations after the Indus Valley&#39;s fall. This flowering occurred in
      the Gangetic Plain, another area flush with fertile soil. Due to advanced agricultural techniques and better practices, surplus grain was produced.
      Business communities began to form, and trade became more widespread with the use of the coin.</p>


      <h2>Mahajanapadas</h2>


      <p>The Mahajanapadas were a collection of monarchies and republics, 16 in number, spread across the Gangetic plains. These were the most massive at the
      time in India, The names of thse are Kashi, Kosala, Magadha, Anga, Vriji/Vaiji, Malla, Vatsa, Kuru, Panchale, Mastsy, Shurasena, Assaka, Avanti,

      <h2>Mauryan Empire</h2>


      <p>The Mauryan empire was the first empire to completely encompass India (save for South India), and also one of the largest to ever exist. It was
      established by Chandragupta Maurya, the empire&#39;s namesake, assisted by a man known as Chanakya. The greatest known emperor of this dynasty was
      Ashoka, under whose rule the empire reached its greatest extent. He was known for his embracement of Buddhism following his war with the Kalingans, which

      <h2>Sangam Period</h2>


      <p>South India has historically been independent of other empires, so between 300 BCE and 400 CE Tamil literature became very expansive, written by
      several people. These books have a variety of subject matter contained within them, ranging from history to culture.</p>
