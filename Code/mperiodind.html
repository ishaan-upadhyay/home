      <h2>Rebellion of 1857</h2>


      <p>After 100 years of British sovereignty, this was the first large-scale rebellion against British rule. Although several soldiers were involved, the
      entire rebellion was very disorganized, and eventually failed. The British Goverment decided in favour of taking complete control of the Company. They
      took the reins of India, and suppressed any opposition.</p>

      <h2>The British Raj</h2>


      <p>The new colony of India now had a strengthened and improved infrastructure via a legal system. Education was amde a priority under the British Raj as
      well. In this time, a Renaissance occurred in Bengal, as several intellectuals were birthed, yet again. The British Raj, however, was marked by a
      decrease of quality of life for regular Indians, but there was a marked improvement afterwards. During British rule, the life expentancy for the average Indian was below 35.</p>


      <h2>Independence movement</h2>


      <p>The Independence movement began at the turn of the 19th century, with an emphasis on Swaraj (self-rule) and then independence. The first icon of the
      movement was Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the one who popularized the Swaraj movement. This in turn began the Swadeshi Movement, the boycott of foreign made
      goods. In 1920, the tensions were flared by Mahatma Gandhi, a revered, almost deified figure in Indian history today. &quot;Mahatma&quot; literally means
      &quot;great soul.&quot; His advocation of &quot;ahimsa/ahinsa&quot; was massively popular and led to mass uprisings throughout India. Through his and
      several others&#39; efforts, India finally attained independence on April 15th, 1947, marking the start of the current era of India.</p>
