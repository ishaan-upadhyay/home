      <p>The Indus Valley Civilization or IVC was one of the first civilizations anywhere on Earth. It predates Ancient Egypt &amp; Mesopotamia, and
      <strong>encompassed more area at its peak than both combined</strong>. The earliest evidence of settlement before the IVC was the Mehrgarh village, a
      settlement <strong>dated to 7000 BCE</strong>. The largest cities were Mohenjo Daro and Harrapa (the first city excavated), and there is evidence of
      complex trade routes and even a sea port at Lothal. The Indus Valley script remains undeciphered to date. It encompassed an area of <strong>1 million
      square miles</strong>, running from northeastern Afghanistan to northwestern India.</p>

      <h2>Early Harappan</h2>
	   <p>The Early Harappan period is defined, more or less, by the fact that it was the precursor to the massive cities of the Mature Harappan period. One city
       of this time is Kot Diji, representing a tendency to gravitate towards centralized power and a higher quality of urban life. Very suddenly, a united
       civilization emerged.Trade networks were developed, and animals were domesticated.</p>

      <h2>Mature Harappan</h2>


      <p>The Mature Harappan period is the bulk of the Indus Valley Civilization&#39;s existence. During this time, the largest cities, Harrapa and Mohenjo
      Daro developed. Many large cities, including Dholavira, Lothal and Rakhigarhi developed subsequently. They were largely concentrated on the drainage
      basin of the Indus river. These cities had the best urban planning of any civilization at the time, including well-arranged neighbourhoods and fully
      functional sewage systems. Each house&#39;s bathroom had a sloping floor to diver water into covered drains along the streets. The architecture was the
      most well developed of the ancient world, with massive granaries, citadels, warehouses and walls (to divert flood waters.)The uniformity of the IVC was
      surprisingly coherent, as there is no evidence pointing to any form of ruling class or autocratic ruler, per se. The scientific discoveries of the IVC
      were quite sophiscated. The smallest denomination of measurement was 1.704mm, the shortest of any ancient civilizat.ions. The weights system of the IVC
      was in perfect ratios, with values ranging from 0.5 to 500 units, where 1 unit = 28 grams. The arts and crafts of the Indus Valley were extremely
      complex, being compared with the times of Hellenistic Greece, albeit much earlier. Seals, statuettes, toys and various other models have been found. The
      language has 500 identified symbols, although none have been deciphered.</p>

      <h2>Late Harappan</h2>


      <p>After 1800 BCE, signs of gradual decay became evident throughout the entire civlization. The main causes cited were a reduction in the seasonal
      streams flushing the region, disallowing large-scale farming. Changes in the course of rivers and weaker monsoons led people to migrate eastwards. In the
      Gangetic Plains, such large-scale communities didn&#39;t form soon enough, not allowing any surplus to be traded.</p>
