      <h1>Basic information</h1>


      <p>The relative peace and self-contained bubble India lived in began to completely burst during this period, as various tribes and clans invaded India,
      and Islamic culture took its roots in India.</p>

      <h2>Growth of Muslims as a population</h2>


      <p>India was often the first of the countries that lay in the warpath of Central Asian tribes, and over time became infused with their culture and
      religion. Slowly over time, as the Muslims became more and more sucessful, they finally conquered India at some point. Although previous rulers had been
      completely assimiliated, these new ones managed to retain a unique identity.</p>


      <h2>Resistance to conquests</h2>


      <p>The Rajputs were a warrior clan of India, who were at the spearhead of the resistance. They had established rule over Delhi in 10th century. The most
      well known Rajput ruler was Prithviraj Chauhan.</p>


      <h2>The Delhi Sultanate</h2>


      <p>This sultanate was a Muslim one based out of Delhi. It presided over large swathes of India from the 13th to mid 16th century. This sultanate was
      result of a larger trend affecting Asia. The Middle Eastern Islamic Caliphate began enslaving non-Muslims, and began expanding outwards.</p>

      <h2>Vijaynagara Empire</h2>


      <p>The Vijaynagara Empire was one of the only empires to survive through the Islamic invasions, as has been the case with Southern India through most of
      history. The capital, Vijaynagara, is near Hampi. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Empire managed to fight back agains the Sultanata, sometime
      decisively annexing territories.</p>
